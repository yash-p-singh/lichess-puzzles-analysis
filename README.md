# Lichess Puzzles Analysis

We explore the [puzzles database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles) published by the chess website lichess, and search for noteworthy insights. While the actual database could unfortunately not be uploaded here due to file size limits, it can be downloaded from the aforementioned website. The analysis and accompanying explanations are presented in the jupyter notebook `lichess-analysis.ipynb`.
